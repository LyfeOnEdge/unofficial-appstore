# unofficial-appstore
A desktop gui for the Homebrew Appstore written in python.

## While it's unlikely to cause too much damage, make a bakup of your sd card before using this program until it has been more thoroughly tested.

Uses the switchbru/4TU team's site as a backend for image and package downloads.
