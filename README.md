# unofficial-appstore
A desktop gui for the Homebrew Appstore written in python.

## While it's unlikely to cause too much damage, make a bakup of your sd card before using this program until it has been more thoroughly tested.

Uses the switchbru/4TU team's site as a backend for image and package downloads.

##### Working Stuff:
 - Dynamic Search
 - Categories
 - Downloading directly from the switchbru/4tu site
 - Tracking with the appstore
 - Opening project pages
 - Threaded operations mean the app no longer becomes unresponsive with big downloads

##### Future plans:
 - Direct memloader integration (SD only) for installation directly over usb
