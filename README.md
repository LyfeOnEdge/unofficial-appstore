# unofficial-appstore
A still-in-infancy desktop gui for the Homebrew Appstore written in python.

##While it's unlikely to cause too much damage, make a bakup of your sd card before using this program until it has been more thoroughly tested.

Uses the switchbru/4TU team's site as a backend for image and package downloads.

##### Working Stuff:

 - Opening Project Page

##### Broken stuff:
 - Large downloads cause blocking until the download is finished (Threading and ui feedback soon)
