##### Working Stuff:
 - Dynamic Search
 - Categories
 - Downloading directly from the switchbru/4tu site
 - Tracking with the appstore
 - Opening project pages
 - Threaded operations mean the app no longer becomes unresponsive with big downloads

##### Future plans:
 - Direct memloader integration (SD only) for installation directly over usb 

# How to use:
##### Windows:
- Extract unofficial-appstore.zip
- Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-373/)
- Double-click start_appstore.bat

##### Macintosh:
- Extract unofficial-appstore.zip
- Mac users may already have a compatible version of python installed, try double-clicking unofficial-appstore.py
--If the file opens in a text reader, close the reader and right-click the file and open it with pylauncher
- If this still doesn't work, install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-373/)

##### Linux:
- Extract unofficial-appstore.zip
- Navigate to the directory in a terminal
- Type "python unofficial-appstore.py"
  - If you are missing dependencies do the following:
  - sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-tk
- If you don't know how to do this you should probably be using Windows ;D
